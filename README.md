# Full-stack-Expense-App

I have created it using node,express,mysql,sequelize,ejs and bootstrap
It contains an Expense table to store all the expenses
User can create expense and add it to the table
And can See the old expenses when he refreshes the page on his screen
can Delete the expenses
Implemented MVC model for clean code
User can also edit any expense.
